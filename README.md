**Week 1 - 9/24 to 9/30 and Week 2 - 10/1 to 10/7**

Basic chess game built using React

**10/1:** Finished the first week with the project incomplete due to state management issues. Decided to use second week to wrap up project and add checkers gamemode.

**10/7:** Chess game is working correctly, win condition is checked for and reset functionality is implemented. Added state button for toggling gamemodes when I eventually implement checkers gamemode.

**Reflections/Improvements for future:** Implement checkers gamemode, optimize calculateMoveHelper function (can probably reduce to a single generic function for checking tiles), prevent King from moving into danger, check for checkmate and add missing moves (castle, pawn trade-in on enemy home row), add display for pieces taken.
