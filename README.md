**Week 1 - 9/24 to 9/30 and Week 2 - 10/1 to 10/7**

Basic chess game built using React

**10/1:** Finished the first week with the project incomplete due to state management issues. Decided to use second week to wrap up project and add checkers gamemode.

**10/7:** Finished second week with a working chess game. Missing logic to prevent king from moving to dangerous tile and castle move for king/rook, as well as checkers gamemode. May return to add missing functionality in the future but it is time for a new project.
